Each column \\\\(W^{(1)}_{\\cdot i}\\\\) represents the weights from the input units to the i-th hidden unit. Typical choices for s include tanh, with \\\\(tanh(a)=(e^a-e^{-a})/(e^a+e^{-a})\\\\), or the logistic sigmoid function, with \\\\(sigmoid(a)=1/(1+e^{-a})\\\\). We will be using tanh in this tutorial because it typically yields to faster training (and sometimes also to better local minima). Both the tanh and sigmoid are scalar-to-scalar functions but their natural extension to vectors and tensors consists in applying them element-wise (e.g. separately on each element of the vector, yielding a same-size vector).\n",

    "The output vector is then obtained as: \\\\(o(x) = G(b^{(2)} + W^{(2)} h(x))\\\\). The reader should recognize the form we already used for Classifying MNIST digits using Logistic Regression. As before, class-membership probabilities can be obtained by choosing G as the softmax function (in the case of multi-class classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an MLP, we learn all parameters of the model, and here we use Stochastic Gradient Descent with minibatches. The set of parameters to learn is the set \\\\( \\theta =\n",
    "\\{W^{(2)},b^{(2)},W^{(1)},b^{(1)}\\}\\\\). Obtaining the gradients \\\\( \\partial{\\ell}/\\partial{\\theta}\\\\) can be achieved through the backpropagation algorithm (a special case of the chain-rule of derivation). Thankfully, since Theano performs automatic differentation, we will not need to cover this in the tutorial !"

    "There are several hyper-parameters in the above code, which are not (and, generally speaking, cannot be) optimized by gradient descent. Strictly speaking, finding an optimal set of values for these hyper-parameters is not a feasible problem. First, we can’t simply optimize each of them independently. Second, we cannot readily apply gradient techniques that we described previously (partly because some parameters are discrete values and others are real-valued). Third, the optimization problem is not convex and finding a (local) minimum would involve a non-trivial amount of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that over the last 25 years, researchers have devised various rules of thumb for choosing hyper-parameters in a neural network. A very good overview of these tricks can be found in Efficient BackProp by Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Genevieve Orr, and Klaus-Robert Mueller. In here, we summarize the same issues, with an emphasis on the parameters and techniques that we actually used in our code.\n",

    "## Nonlinearity\n",
    "Two of the most common ones are the sigmoid and the tanh function. For reasons explained in Section 4.4, nonlinearities that are symmetric around the origin are preferred because they tend to produce zero-mean inputs to the next layer (which is a desirable property). Empirically, we have observed that the tanh has better convergence properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weight initialization\n",
    "At initialization we want the weights to be small enough around the origin so that the activation function operates in its linear regime, where gradients are the largest. Other desirable properties, especially for deep networks, are to conserve variance of the activation as well as variance of back-propagated gradients from layer to layer. This allows information to flow well upward and downward in the network and reduces discrepancies between layers. Under some assumptions, a compromise between these two constraints leads to the following initialization:  $ uniform[-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}},\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}}] $ for tanh and $ uniform[-4*\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}},4*\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}}]$ for sigmoid. Where $fan_{in}$ is the number of inputs and $fan_{out}$ the number of hidden units. For mathematical considerations please refer to [Xavier10].\n",

    "## Learning rate\n",
    "There is a great deal of literature on choosing a good learning rate. The simplest solution is to simply have a constant rate. Rule of thumb: try several log-spaced values $(10^{-1},10^{-2},\\ldots)$ and narrow the (logarithmic) grid search to the region where you obtain the lowest validation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decreasing the learning rate over time is sometimes a good idea. One simple rule for doing that is $\\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + d\\times t}$ where $\\mu_0$ is the initial rate (chosen, perhaps, using the grid search technique explained above), d is a so-called “decrease constant” which controls the rate at which the learning rate decreases (typically, a smaller positive number, $10^{-3}$ and smaller) and t is the epoch/stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 4.7 details procedures for choosing a learning rate for each parameter (weight) in our network and for choosing them adaptively based on the error of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of hidden units\n",
    "This hyper-parameter is very much dataset-dependent. Vaguely speaking, the more complicated the input distribution is, the more capacity the network will require to model it, and so the larger the number of hidden units that will be needed (note that the number of weights in a layer, perhaps a more direct measure of capacity, is $D\\times D_h$ (recall D is the number of inputs and D_h is the number of hidden units).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless we employ some regularization scheme (early stopping or L1/L2 penalties), a typical number of hidden units vs. generalization performance graph will be U-shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization parameter\n",
    "Typical values to try for the L1/L2 regularization parameter $\\lambda$ are $10^{-2},10^{-3},\\ldots$. In the framework that we described so far, optimizing this parameter will not lead to significantly better solutions, but is worth exploring nonetheless."
